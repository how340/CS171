            <div class="col-7 justify-content-center">
                <p>This graph is a great demonstration of the trend in the distribution of the world life expectancy over the 16-year period between 2000 and 2015.</p>
                <p>A boxplot is a direct and clear way of displaying important discrete numerical summary statistics on a population.
                    A boxplot can effectively capture quantile information, range, and outliers. Because of the graph choice, we see a clear
                    trend of a slowly increasing global life expectancy, reflected by the increasing median and increasing extreme (upper and lower) values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we are interested in the performance of global life expectancy, we are less concerned about individuality of each 
                    data point. Replacing individual data points with boxes and lines reduces visual clutter and allow us to focus on the important question. 
                    Furthermore, different realization of each statistics (i.e. range as box/lines; quantile as horizontal lines) allows the reader to 
                    quickly distinguish between the different information.

            <div class="col-7 justify-content-center">
                <p>In comparison, this graph does a worse job in reflecting the global trend in life expectancy.</p>
                <p>First off, the second graph chooses to focus on the individual statistics of each country by showing the discrete numerical life expectancy value of each country as a dot along a vertical line.
                    This causes some visual clutter on the graph. Importantly, this choice doesn't introduce any additional information as there is no 
                    way to distinguish between each data point (all countries look the same). Thus, there is little reason to go in this direction.
                </p>
                <p>Secondly, it is very difficult to gauge the shift in the middle point of the population. Visually, we can attempt to gauge the shift in population
                    through the top and bottom extremes. However, this could be deceptive in many situations, where the movement of extreme values could have little effect on the median/mean.
                </p>
                <p>In conclusion, the first graph does a much better job on displaying trends in global life expectancy than the second graph due to the better choice in the types of graph employed.</p>
